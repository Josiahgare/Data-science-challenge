# Data-science-challenge
Building model to predict customer likelihood to churn

**Host:** Coursera

**Client:** Video Streaming Company (VSC)

**Problem statement:** VSC wants to know the likelihood of customer churn on their platforms.

**Solution:** Building a model to help VSC solve this problem and keep them proactively involved in retaining their customers.

## Dataset
Three dataset was provided; 
- Data description: gives description to the data features
- Train (243787, 21) to train the model and find the champion model with best evaluation score
- Test (104480, 20) to use champion model on to predict customer churn probability

Note: [Train data on google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SDhTmbXEBtFOW01AHBSBe9x6FhLm9ZcN/view?usp=sharing)

## Analysis
- The data was loaded and checked for errors, none was found
- Exploratory data analysis was done to derive insight
- Data preprocessing was done to prepare the data for model development
- Logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost models were developed and scored
- Predicting on Test data
- Saving prediction as csv file

## Submission of challenge
Final prediction was submitted as csv file and scored 89th percentile

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of customer's behavior.
